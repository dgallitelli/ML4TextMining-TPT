    "# TP4 - Non-negative Matrix Factorization\n",
    "The goal is to study the use of nonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF) for topic extraction from a dataset of text documents. The rationale is to interpret each extracted NMF component as being associated with a specific topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Study and test the following script (introduced  on [scikit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test and comment on the effect of varying the initialisation, especially using random\n",
    "nonnegative values as initial guesses (for W and H coefficients, using the notations introduced\n",
    "during the lecture).\n",
    "2. Compare and comment on the difference between the results obtained with `2 cost compared\n",
    "to the generalised Kullback-Liebler cost.\n",
    "3. Test and comment on the results obtained using a simpler term-frequency representation\n",
    "as input (as opposed to the TF-IDF representation considered in the code above) when\n",
    "considering the Kullback-Liebler cost."
